## 🚀 Problem Statement

### **Why This Project Matters**

**Description:**
Low Earth Orbit (LEO) is rapidly evolving into a commercial and scientific frontier, but existing infrastructure is limited, expensive, and primarily government-run. At the same time:

- Space debris is increasing, posing risks to spacecraft and long-term orbital safety.
- Tourism in orbit is currently limited to a handful of wealthy individuals.
- Educational opportunities for students to engage with space are minimal.
- According to NASA’s Orbital Debris Program Office, millions of fragments of debris orbit the Earth, creating collision hazards.

**Our goal:** Create a platform that bridges these gaps — a safe, sustainable, and scalable orbital hotel that combines tourism, research, and education.

## 🔧 Feasibility

### **Technologically and Operationally Achievable**

**Description:**
Advances in reusable rockets, modular construction, and life-support systems make this hotel feasible. The station will orbit between 400–500 km, minimizing debris risk and benefiting from Earth’s magnetosphere for radiation protection.

**Challenges & Mitigations:**

- Whipple shielding and real-time debris tracking.
- Water-wall shielding and safe zones for radiation protection.
- Greenhouse and communal areas to support mental health in microgravity.

> NASA studies confirm modular life-support systems and orbital habitats are proven technologies.
